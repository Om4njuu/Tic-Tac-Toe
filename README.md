# Tic Tac Toe

## Description

The **Tic Tac Toe Game** is a classic two-player game where users take turns to mark X or O in a 3x3 grid. The goal is to be the first player to get three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This project is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, showcasing basic game logic, DOM manipulation, and responsive design. It includes a restart button, a status display for the current player's turn, and checks for win/draw conditions.
